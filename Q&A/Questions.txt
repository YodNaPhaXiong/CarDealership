Questions (put your Inital after your question)
=========
- Do we have to keep track of max capsicity for each dealer for enable and disable? - YX
Answer: No, the enablement/disablement will be done by the user, you don’t have to keep track of the lot capactities.

- How do we contribute as a group on www.websequencediagrams.com, so that we all could work together at the same time? -JD
Answer: Doing it at the same time is tricky, but you can store the text from the site as a text file an put it into GitHub.  That way the next person to work on it can copy paste it into the website.

-- Requrements specify that vehicles be associated with Dealers. 
	1. Where are these dealers coming from? (MJ)
Answer: They are existing dealerships.  There is no address associated with it, but you don’t need it anyway.  You might consider how a new dealership can be added.

	2. How we assume all dealer Ids in the JSON file are valid? (MJ)
Answer: Yes, you can assume they are valid, if it is not one you have seen before, assume that it is a new dealership.

	3. Is there a separate dealer database/repository we can look-up dealers?  (MJ)
Answer: No, not at this time., we are focusing on tracking the vehicles and not the dealerships.

-- Requirements mention that "Admins" can use tracking service to record vehicles arriving at Dealers
	1. Should we assume these Admins already exist? (MJ)
Answer: The “admins” are the users of the software.  They don’t need to be tracked by the software.

	2. Do we need to create Users and handle user access and security?  (MJ)
Answer: It is not listed in the requirements, so you don’t have to, but you are welcome to if you want.
